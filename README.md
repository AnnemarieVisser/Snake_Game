# Snake game
This game is made using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Added to the game:
- Added a snake
- Added apples
- Added a start button that also functions as re-start
- Got the snake moving
- Snake grows and speeds up after eating an apple
- Added a stop button
- Have no apple spawn before start, only after clicking
- Add reset button
- Working keyboard buttons on the page so you can control it on mobile/tablet
- Added a switch to determine direction of the snake
- A "You lost the game" message after hitting a wall or eating yourself
- Improved Apple design

### To-do list
Even a simple game as Snake can have lots of to-be-improved points! These are the points I'm working on:
- Improved Snake design
- Set fixed max speed
- Fix Bugs
- A "You won the game" message if you've eaten all the apples
- Level system (snake moving faster, larger grid)
- High score feature (send score to remote database, shows top x scores)
- Buttons run their own function in stead of passing through a switch

### Known Bugs
- Snake goes crazy when an apple spawns inside of his body
- Snake eats itself when you mash buttons too fast

- Snake does not reset speed when you lose and press Start again (Fixed)
