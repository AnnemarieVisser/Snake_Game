# Snake game
This game is made using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Added to the game:
- Added a snake
- Added apples
- Added a start button that also functions as re-start
- Got the snake moving
- Snake grows and speeds up after eating an apple
- Added a stop button

### To-do list
Even a simple game as Snake can have lots of to-be-improved points! These are the points I'm working on:
- Add a "stop" button
- Have no apple spawn before start, only after clicking
- Improved Snake design
- Improved Apple design (I mean, come on, let that snake eat a mouse!)
- Improved overall appearance
- Working keyboard buttons on the page so you can control it on mobile/tablet
- A "You lost the game" message after hitting a wall or eating yourself
- A "You won the game" message if you've eaten all the mice
- Level system (snake moving faster, larger grid)
- High score feature (send score to remote database, shows top x scores)
